# Getting Started with D3

This is a ClojureScript version of the code repository for the book [Getting Started with D3](https://github.com/mikedewar/getting_started_with_d3).

The code was translated line by line from Javascript to ClojureScript whenever possible.

As a result it is possible to read the book while looking at the ClojureScript code.
